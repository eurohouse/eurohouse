Sorry, babe. I'm an ambitious girl. And you, you're just small time.
Liberty city is in shock today, as the police and emergency services deal with the aftermath, of a devastating attack on a police convoy this morning. As yet, no details have been released about the prisoners being transferred in the convoy, and no group, has claimed responsibility. The convoy left Police headquarters early this morning, for a routine transfer of felons, to Liberty Penitentiary. The attack took place on the Callahan Bridge, leaving few witnesses, and the bridge itself, severely damaged. Some of the convicts are thought to have perished, in the explosion that followed the initial attack. Revelations as to the professionalism of the attack, struck police hours afterward, when identification of the missing felons were further hampered by an attack, by computer hackers on Police headquarter databases. With the Porter tunnel-project falling behind schedule, this disaster leaves Portland isolated from the rest of the city.
Come on! Señor dickhead! It's no problem to kill you. You gonna be sorry.
A'right, a'right. Get lost.
